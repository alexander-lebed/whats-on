# TypeScript Conventions

- Use `type` instead of `interface` for consistency and better union/intersection handling.
- Favor **type inference** when possible to reduce verbosity.
- Always annotate **function return types** and public method signatures.
- Leverage utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Record`, etc.) where appropriate.
